# Adding Friends as Test Users - Sebastian's Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Instead of having each friend create their own Google Cloud project, you can simply add them as test users to your existing project. This is much simpler!

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

- **Super simple for friends** - No Google Cloud setup needed
- **One project to manage** - You control everything
- **Same credentials.json** - Everyone uses the same file
- **Easy user management** - Add/remove friends easily
- **Up to 100 friends** - Plenty for personal sharing

## 📋 How to Add Friends as Test Users

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your Gmail Bot project
3. Go to **"APIs & Services" → "OAuth consent screen"**

### Step 2: Add Test Users
1. Scroll down to **"Test users"** section
2. Click **"+ ADD USERS"**
3. Enter your friend's Gmail address
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Repeat for each friend

### Step 3: Share Files with Friends
Give each friend:
- **All bot files** (`gm.py`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- **Your `credentials.json`** file
- **The updated friend setup guide**

## 📁 What Friends Get

```

├── FRIEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md     # Simplified setup guide
├── start_bot.bat             # Windows launcher
├── start_bot.sh              # Mac/Linux launcher
└── setup.sh                  # Mac/Linux setup script
```

## 🚀 Friend Setup Process (Super Simple!)

1. **Download files** from you
2. **Install Python** (if needed)
3. **Run setup script** or follow guide
4. **Customize their settings**
5. **Run the bot**

**No Google Cloud account needed!** ✨

## 👥 Managing Your Test Users

### Current Test Users
You can see all test users in Google Cloud Console:
- **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
- **Test users** section shows everyone

### Adding More Friends
- Maximum: **100 test users**
- Just add their Gmail addresses
- They can start using immediately

### Removing Friends
- Click the **X** next to their email
- Their access is revoked immediately

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Sharing credentials.json
- **You're sharing API access** - Friends use your project
- **Monitor usage** - Check API quotas if needed
- **Trust level** - Only share with people you trust
- **Revoke access** - Can remove users anytime

### Rate Limits
- **Gmail API limits** apply to your project
- **Normal usage is fine** - Checking email every 5 minutes is minimal
- **Multiple users** - Shouldn't hit limits with typical use

## 📊 Monitoring Usage

### Check API Usage
1. **Google Cloud Console** → **APIs & Services** → **Dashboard**
2. **Select Gmail API**
3. **View quotas and usage**

### Typical Usage Per User
- **Reading emails**: ~10-50 requests/day
- **Sending replies**: ~5-20 requests/day
- **Total per user**: ~100 requests/day maximum

**With 10 friends**: ~1,000 requests/day (well within free limits)

## 🎛️ What You Control

As the project owner, you control:
- **Who can use the bot** (test user list)
- **API quotas and limits**
- **Security settings**
- **Project billing** (though Gmail API is free for normal use)

## 📞 Support for Friends

When friends have issues:
1. **Check if they're added** as test users
2. **Verify credentials.json** is in their folder
3. **Check setup guide** troubleshooting section
4. **Test user limit** - Maybe you hit 100 users?

## 🔄 Updating the Bot

When you improve the bot:
1. **Update your files**
2. **Share new files** with friends
3. **No Google Cloud changes** needed
4. **Friends just replace files** and restart

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Organize Your Test Users
- **Keep a list** of who you've added
- **Group by purpose** (family, work friends, etc.)
- **Document who requested features**

### Communication
- **Let friends know** when you add them
- **Share the guide** so they know what to do
- **Create a group chat** for questions/updates

### Version Control
- **Keep the latest bot version** organized
- **Number your releases** (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- **Share changelogs** when you update
